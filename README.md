<br>
<span>3. Pages Included:</span>
<li>Homepage (index.html) with all main sections</li>
<li>Contact page (contact.html) with form and map</li>
<br>
<span>4. JavaScript Functionality:</span>

<p>The website is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks or libraries (except Font Awesome for icons). It maintains the same professional appearance and functionality as the previous Next.js version but uses traditional web development techniques.

To complete the website, you would need to create the remaining pages (practice-areas.html, attorneys.html, blog.html, about.html) following the same structure and styling patterns established in the provided files.</p>
